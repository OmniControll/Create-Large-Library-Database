# Create-Large-Library-Database
create_large_database.py - README

Overview

The create_large_database.py script is designed to create and populate a SQLite database with synthetic data.

It makes use of the Faker library to generate fake user and book data, allowing for the simulation of a library system.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Faker library: Used for generating synthetic data.

sqlite3 library: Integrated within Python's standard library for interacting with SQLite databases.

Usage

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install Faker

Run the script using the following command:

python create_large_database.py

Database Structure

The script creates/connects to an SQLite database located at specified file location.

Tables included:

Users: Information about library users

Books: Details about the books in the library.

Borrowers: Information about users who have borrowed books.

Loans: Details about the loan transactions.

(Note: For a detailed structure of each table, refer to the script.)

Customization

You can modify the database path by changing the conn variable in the script.

The number of records for each table can be adjusted by modifying the relevant loop count.

Disclaimer

This script generates synthetic data, which might not represent real-world scenarios. It is intended for testing and demonstration purposes only.
